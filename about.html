<p><strong>Green Meram</strong> is an initiative under the <em>Green Champion Campaign</em>, aimed at spreading environmental awareness across oil & gas worksites and local communities.</p>
<p>The campaign seeks to inspire every individual — from employees to community members — to become an active “Green Champion” by adopting small yet meaningful actions that collectively contribute to a greener, cleaner, and healthier planet. Through a series of awareness programs, workshops, green talks, and on-site environmental activities, participants will 
  gain practical knowledge about waste management, energy conservation, pollution prevention, and biodiversity protection..</p>
  <p>One of the key goals of the campaign is to integrate environmental considerations into daily operations and decision-making processes across Project MERAM. By encouraging participation and collaboration, we aim to build a strong sense of ownership and responsibility toward our natural surroundings. The campaign will also highlight innovative sustainability efforts within
    the project, showcasing best practices and success stories that can inspire others to follow suit.</p>
  <p>As we progress through this 30-day journey, we reaffirm our belief that environmental protection is not just a responsibility, but an opportunity — an opportunity to create lasting positive change for future generations. The GREEN CHAMPION Campaign reflects our vision to make Project MERAM a benchmark for
    environmental excellence, teamwork, and continuous improvement. Together, we can make a difference — one action, one choice, and one champion at a time.</p>
